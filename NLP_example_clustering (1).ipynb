       " 'At ZorgSpectrum we are looking for: Helping Plus / Nurturing IG Familiar Home In brief What are you going to do? In addition to the necessary daily care, you are given the freedom to do what the client and caregiver need. Even if this is simply reading the newspaper together, shopping at the supermarket, cooking a meal together or going to a museum. So you actually make your client feel like a full human being. You give care with full attention to the well-being of the client. You work together with general practitioners and other disciplines. You identify problems and solve them in a multidisciplinary manner. You will work in Nieuwegein, Houten and Vianen. Salary Helping Plus: FWG 30 CLA VVT, between € 1808.83 and € 2554.98 based on 36 hours. With a year-end bonus of 8.3% Salary Caregiver IG: FWG 35 CLA VVT, between € 1,999.37 and € 2,668.93 based on 36 hours. And you will also receive an end-of-year bonus of 8.3%. Required experience: Love for the profession, someone with a natural curiosity about people and a nationally recognized Helpende Plus certificate (and Helpende Zorg en Welzijn diploma) and diploma Care IG (level 3). Where are you going to work? We are looking for you for our teams in Houten and Nieuwegein.  The function There is a reason that you once chose to enter healthcare: you have a certain kind of love for people and you put this compassion fully into your work. When you work with our special care concept, Trusted home, you get a number of things from us: freedom, time and a group of fantastic colleagues. Read on to find out exactly what you\\'ll be doing in this creative \"Home Care 2.0 Job\". We think it will make you enthusiastic! What is Trusted Home? Sometimes someone wishes to stay at home as long as possible. We understand that: you have your own familiar environment and your own place to which you are so attached. Moving to a different environment can be very exciting. The care often comes down to the informal caregiver, but he or she also knows his or her limits. And we can help with that. We would therefore be happy to tell you more about our special care concept, Trusted home. Trusted home has an incredibly broad package of care responsibilities, but we try to explain it to you as simply as possible: if the GP refers the client to the Mobile Geriatric Team (MGT), they will draw up a treatment plan and care plan together with Trusted home. . This team consists of a psychologist, a specialist in geriatric medicine and a case manager. The client therefore has a very clear desire to live at home as long as possible. Completely understandable. But how do you actually do that? What kind of care does the client need? And, of course, just as important: what does the informal caregiver need for this so that they can survive? So at Vertrouwen at home we help the client, but we also stand next to the informal caregiver. That way he also has time for himself now and then and we hope to take the pressure off. Sadly, we cannot cure the disease, but we can help. Why is it actually called Familiar home? When we explain what we do, people often react with surprise. We have not been doing what we do for very long and we are quite unique in the Netherlands. It is a bit like home care, after all you come to someone\\'s home there. But it certainly is not! At Vertrouwen at home we help various care groups. Our largest group are people with dementia in the broadest sense of the word, such as someone with Alzheimer\\'s disease, vascular dementia or Parkinson\\'s. We also help when someone has physical problems or, for example, has had a cerebral infarction. So we help people who need more serious care than \"traditional home care or district nursing\" can provide. The mental care that we can provide is therefore more than necessary in this situation. In order to help, the client must trust you completely. This means that you have to get to know someone: the person behind the client. Only with genuine attention and time will you have the opportunity to gain someone\\'s trust. Does this work well? Then see that care for clients is in small things. For example, you will soon have someone on your team who regularly drives a car with a client, because automotive engineering is his greatest passion. And what do you say to simply read a newspaper together? Or to the museum together? Or put on some nice old-Dutch music and sing together while peeling the potatoes together. Either way: as a professional you work in freedom with the client to create that trust. Your Trusted team to come Home yourself In your new job, you pay full attention to your client, but we also urge you not to forget yourself. Is that happening after all in the issues of the day? Then you have a team of colleagues to whom you can tell and ask everything. We keep the teams small on purpose, so that you pay more attention to each other. Are you one a day uncomfortable in your skin? Or do you want a few days off next week? Feel free to ask, we are sure someone will catch you. Perhaps we could even substitute the word \"teams\" for \"professional friendships.\" They cry together, but also laugh to release. The silly jokes are flying around your ears. The homemade sweets - “just because I love you” - by the way. But these little things make you enjoy your job every day. Who are you? Because you work very independently at clients\\' homes, for this special job you must have your MBO Nursing (level 4) or Care IG (level 3) diploma. Then you can provide the most complete care. Furthermore, we set the utmost requirement that you read this vacancy at this time and get a warm feeling inside. Then apply! What do you get? As a Helping Plus you will receive your salary based on FWG 30 according to the collective labor agreement VVT based on 36 hours. As a care worker you will receive your wages based on scale FWG 35 according to the collective labor agreement VVT based on 36 hours. By the way, did you already know that as of June 1, 2020 you have had a salary increase of 3.5%? The following year in July 2021, you will receive an additional 3% on top. You also receive a nice end-of-year bonus of 8.3%. Because we are happy with you and know how special a real care heart is, you will also immediately receive a contract for an indefinite period. Do you still need a good bike to go to work? Then you can use our bicycle plan. Furthermore, you will of course receive every opportunity to learn and develop further. That is why you can take training courses or courses at our expense to further develop yourself. Apply Have you become enthusiastic? Then apply immediately via the button \"apply\".

The real deal: As soon as you start with the real work, you prepare the equipment at home and then take it with you to the patient. He / she will give you good information about the research at his / her home and you will install the equipment. The nurse disconnects itself the next morning and sends the device to you (the nurse). You then retrieve the information obtained from the device with your computer, after which it can be sent to the client. The recorder can then be cleaned and used on the next patient. Job requirements: You are the business card of the organization and take the wishes / questions of the patient into account; Certified Nurse (MBO / HBO), with valid BIG registration; You have the opportunity to use a computer with Windows; You are in possession of a car and driver's license; You are willing to travel up to approximately 35 km to the patient; You preferably have recent and relevant experience within SAC or home care; Available in the evening.

Job description ** We currently have room for several nurses who can start immediately. **  Adding energy to care in the unique combination of surgical and contemplative specialties. Working as a nurse within the Heart / Vascular / Lung theme is quite special. You work in an academic setting, in which we have organized care around the patient in an innovative way. The specialisms Cardiology, Cardio-Thoracic Surgery, Vascular Surgery, Lung Diseases and Lung Surgery work together as one theme, in a combination that is unique in the Netherlands. A theme where you deal with a wide variety of patients and with exceptional and highly complex conditions on a daily basis. Patients who come to us from all over the country for treatment by our specialist doctors and reputable professors. In addition to care to patients who stay with us for a short period of time, for example for a surgical procedure, we also provide care to patients with, for example, a chronic lung, vascular or heart disease who have been with us for longer or more often. A special combination of very different (surgical and contemplative) specialisms. Each specialty with its own dynamics.  This means that at one point you provide care in which standardized action according to protocols is central. The other moment you are at the bedside with a patient who is ill for a long time or who is incurable and where it mainly revolves around psychosocial guidance and support. Or you are confronted with an acute situation in which you immediately have to make decisions and set priorities. That gives a lot of variety and makes your work very dynamic, but it also means that you have to switch continuously and quickly. As a nurse you have an important directing role in healthcare. The doctor is ultimately responsible, but you are indispensable for the coordination of the daily care of patients. At the end of this year, we will also be one of the first to start job differentiation in the context of Future-proof nursing.  We treat patients of different ages, young and old. In which we strive for the best person-centered care in all cases. We want to give patients positive energy, regardless of personal circumstances. Every day, as a team, going the extra mile is important to us. In addition, we are an academic theme with highly innovative treatment methods. And where, based on scientific research, there are continuous pilots to further improve these treatment methods.  We see many complex conditions. Patients who cannot (anymore) be helped elsewhere, come to us regularly. We realize that working within the Heart / Vascular / Lung theme demands quite a lot from nurses. That is why we continuously invest in your training and development. And as a team we structurally share knowledge and experience with each other. We also expect you to take the initiative yourself.   Profile Energetic nurses who want to improve themselves and the care of patients every day. You are a HBO-V graduated and BIG registered nurse. Or MBO-V certified with relevant work experience. You already have the necessary experience as a nurse or you have just completed your training. You can work well together in a team, but if the situation demands it, you can also make independent decisions. You are ambitious, you always want to get the most out of yourself and hard work is in your nature.  Providing the best care to patients in an energetic and personal way is an important goal for you. You are resistant to stress, you can organize well and work systematically is a matter of course for you. You are flexible and you stand firmly in your shoes under all circumstances. But above all, you are also a pleasant and social colleague. Someone with a positive attitude who knows how to get and give constructive feedback.  Are you a nurse with all the necessary experience? Then we would like to give you a responsible role in coaching and guiding less experienced colleagues in addition to your normal work.  Have you just left school and is this the first step in your care career? During an extensive induction period, but also afterwards, we guide you intensively and we offer you \\'tailor-made\\' all kinds of training options in order to acquire the necessary knowledge.

A care group consists of several specialisms. You are linked to one care group yourself, but the care groups also exchange colleagues among themselves. You are a specialist in your own care group (for example as a vascular nurse), in another care group you have a more general role. The care groups work together in a \"harmonica model\": the capacity is filled in / distributed with each other in a flexible manner.  The Heart / Vascular / Lung theme has a total of approximately 70 beds and we are admitted to patients undergoing cardiovascular or lung surgery or who have acute or chronic lung disease or cardiovascular disease. We have a real training culture. We believe the continuous personal and substantive development of our people is crucial. In addition, approximately 75 students do an internship with us every year.  As a theme, we are a very diverse, but close-knit team. Together we work hard and in a professional manner every day to provide the best personalized care for our patients. But we are also a team that treats each other very personally and as good colleagues. We encourage you to express your opinion honestly and share emotions in difficult moments. And there is also a lot of laughter, because in our eyes that is part of it. Moreover, we regularly do fun things together outside working hours. That can be an organized outing, but often we just spontaneously have a drink together. In short, we think our work is very important, but the bow cannot always be tense. Will you join our team?

Just try to get in touch without an appointment. On the way back from your scheduled appointment, you stop at the scanned company and try to talk to the right person. If you didn't succeed, but you can leave your card and information behind, you continue with the cold acquisition at the office. You plan a new “cold canvas” round for yourself at that business park and call that company again. Your tenacity will be rewarded with an appointment! At the end of the day, a meeting is planned with the Fleetsales department where the joint objectives are discussed with Freek, as you often serve the same customers.

If there are contraindications, the patient will remain on a waiting list for admission, for example. The patient's practitioner is kept informed of the developments in the treatment and involved where necessary, for example in the form of a ZAG meeting during which a good division of tasks must be discussed.  In addition to the detoxification of alcohol, which we offer at the patients' homes, since this year we also offer detoxification of other substances, such as Oxycodone. Detoxification at home is often preferable to hospitalization for other means as well. It mainly has a positive effect on the recovery process. In addition, the pressure on the waiting lists for outpatient and inpatient Detox will decrease. If, for whatever reason, the detox at home does not work, there is always a possibility for a clinical detox in the background at a department in the Kliniek Rotterdam Alexander for short or, where necessary, a long-term admission.

Within Amerpoort, the MVG target group works according to Spoor A and it is important to strive for the (restoration of) normal life for clients. Within Track A there are three pillars v Your role as MVG Coordinating Supervisor (behavior that is difficult to understand) is twofold. First of all, by working in a structured way you ensure safety and clearly for the 6 young adult men with moderate to severe intellectual disabilities. The proximity and involvement of trusted counselors and family help young adults develop their self-confidence, social and emotional skills. From this safe basis, space is created to do all kinds of things. Clients receive a lot of personal attention and guidance on a social and emotional level from trusted people. Living together in a group brings structure to the day.  Clients can undertake all kinds of activities themselves in the safe environment of Nieuwenoord in Baarn. The young adults are mobile and like to be active and are therefore often on the road. They go to the daytime activities, with a guide to the zoo, build huts in the woods or have a drink in Hilversum or in the pub of Nieuwenoord.  As a Supervisor you work methodically and cyclically. These clients can exhibit difficult to understand behavior and have an intensive care demand. You give them the confidence that together you can take a step further every day, even though there are sometimes difficult situations with difficult to understand behavior, including, (physical and verbal) aggression.

Together with colleagues, you ensure a pleasant and homely atmosphere in the group and you strive for a pleasant and 'normal' life for the clients. You convert the knowledge that there is about clients with difficult to understand behavior into goals and a way of guiding. You evaluate this re elaborately with the team. You observe the client's behavior, you discuss changes with your colleagues and you think along about solutions and alternatives. You implement long-term treatment and development plans, for example aimed at behavioral regulation and development. You maintain close contact with relatives. You don't turn your hand for organizational tasks. Within the team you have a number of focus areas (such as safety, scheduling or finances).
